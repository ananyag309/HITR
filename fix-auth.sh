echo "===================================="
echo ""

echo "🛠️ Applied fixes for JWT authentication:"
echo "✅ Enhanced token extraction using js-cookie"
echo "✅ Added token validation and expiration checking"
echo "✅ Improved error handling for 401 responses"
echo "✅ Added detailed debugging logs"
echo "✅ Graceful fallback for unauthorized requests"
echo ""

echo "🔧 To resolve the 401 authentication error:"
echo ""
echo "1. 🔄 RESTART both servers (this is important!):"
echo "   Terminal 1: Ctrl+C, then npm run dev"
echo "   Terminal 2: Ctrl+C, then cd frontend && npm run dev"
echo ""

echo "2. 🧹 CLEAR browser cookies:"
echo "   • Press F12 → Application → Cookies"
echo "   • Delete all cookies for localhost:5173"
echo "   • Or try incognito/private browsing"
echo ""

echo "3. 🔐 FRESH LOGIN:"
echo "   • Go to /login"
echo "   • Login with existing credentials"
echo "   • OR signup with new account"
echo ""

echo "4. 🔍 CHECK console logs:"
echo "   • Frontend: Look for token preview and validation"
echo "   • Backend: Look for auth middleware logs"
echo ""

echo "5. 🧪 TEST authentication:"
echo "   • Bell icon should appear without errors"
echo "   • Try creating a question/answer"
echo "   • Check notifications work"
echo ""

echo "🚨 If issues persist:"
echo "   • Check JWT_SECRET is set in backend .env"
echo "   • Verify MongoDB connection is working"
echo "   • Try completely different browser"
echo "   • Check if any browser extensions block cookies"
echo ""

echo "📋 Debug commands:"
echo "   chmod +x debug-auth.sh && ./debug-auth.sh"

echo "✨ The authentication system now has:"
echo "   • Better token validation"
echo "   • Automatic expiration handling" 
echo "   • Comprehensive error logging"
echo "   • Graceful degradation for guests"
